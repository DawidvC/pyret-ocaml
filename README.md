#Pyret OCaml Port
This repository is a port of the [Pyret][1] compiler to OCaml, primarily for my own personal learning's sake. Be warned: this entire repository is a construction zone!

## Roadmap
The gameplan for this project is as follows:

1. Do a direct port from the Pyret self-hosted compiler to OCaml (in progress)
2. Refactor the port to better coincide with OCaml idioms
3. Add various abstractions, hopefully culminating in the ability to have multiple compiler targets
